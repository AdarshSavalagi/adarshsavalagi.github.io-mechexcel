    { title: 'Hot Tapping', image: pipeline, data: 'Hot tapping, or pressure tapping, is a non-disruptive method connecting to existing piping or vessels without halting operations. It facilitates maintenance, modifications, and sensor installation without interrupting functionality. Our proven expertise spans various sizes and pressures, emphasizing safety with specialized procedures and well-stocked equipment inventory.' },
    { title: 'Line Stopping', image: industry, data: 'Line stopping, a pivotal isolation method, creates a shut-off in pipelines without existing valves. This temporary control facilitates alterations or valve replacements. Using a hot tap, a stopper attaches to a temporary valve, sealing the pipe hydraulically or mechanically. MECHEXCEL offers diverse line stop techniques, including the innovative CAM-LOR plug interlock system, prioritizing top-notch pipeline modification services.' },
    { title: 'Cold Cutting', image: manufacture, data: 'MECHEXCEL provides a range of pipe operations with precision exterior diameter mounted pipe cutting and beveling machines. They accommodate several wall thicknesses and materials, including carbon steel, alloy steel, stainless steel, and more, with a range that extends from 3 to 48 inches. Perfect for needs including thorough pipeline end preparation.' },
    { title: 'Pigging', image: industry, data: 'MECHEXCEL tailors bespoke pigging programs for pipeline maintenance, leveraging unique history and pigging data. Their comprehensive approach includes meticulous pipeline assessment, custom cleaning plans, pig selection, and real-time tracking.
